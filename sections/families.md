# Families of Sets

We introduce a few important families of sets.

<div class="box definition">
  <div class="title">Definition (Sigma-Algebra)</div>
  A **σ-algebra** over a set Ω is a family of subsets closed under complement and countable unions.

Here is some new in-between text.

<div class="box theorem">
  <div class="title">Theorem (Basic Property)</div>
  If $\mathcal{F}$ is a σ-algebra, then it contains the empty set.
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Proof</button>
<div class="content">
  Since $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under complements, $\varnothing \in \mathcal{F}$.
