  <div class="title">Sigma-Algebra</div>
  A **$\sigma$-algebra** over a set $\Omega$ is a family of subsets closed under complement and countable unions.
</div>

<div class="box theorem">
  <div class="title">Basic Property</div>
  If $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, then $\varnothing \in \mathcal{F}$.
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Proof</button>
<div class="content">
  Since $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under complements, we also have $\varnothing \in \mathcal{F}$.
