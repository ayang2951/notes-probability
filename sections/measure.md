# Measure Theory

<div class="definition" data-title="Definition: σ-algebra">
A $\sigma$-algebra on a set $\Omega$ is a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ 
that is closed under complements and countable unions.
</div>

<div class="theorem" data-title="Theorem 1.1: Measure Extension">
Every pre-measure on an algebra of sets extends to a measure on the $\sigma$-algebra it generates.
</div>

<details>
<summary>Proof</summary>
This follows from Carathéodory’s extension theorem.
